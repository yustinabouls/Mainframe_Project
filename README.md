# Project1: Mainframe COBOL Application 🚀

Welcome to Project1, a meticulously coded Mainframe project written in COBOL. This application is engineered to handle complex data operations with exceptional efficiency and accuracy. 

## Key Features 🔑

### DataSplit.cbl
Data division is now easier than ever. This feature separates the input data records into two output data files based on Transaction Code, generating a comprehensive report of each record type.

### Edit.cbl
This feature enhances the integrity of your data by editing programs and records. It outputs two files, Valid and Invalid, giving you complete control over the data quality.

### ReturnsProcessing.cbl
Get a detailed report of returns along with summary statistics. It's an excellent feature to have a high-level overview and deep insights into your returns.

### S-LProcessing.cbl
This is a sales reporting powerhouse! The feature generates a detailed report of all sales and presents summary statistics to inform strategic decisions.

## Data Files 🗂️
The application operates on several data files, namely:

- project8.dat
- invalid-project8.dat
- returns.dat
- salesprocessing.dat
- valid-project8.dat

Each of these data files contributes to the smooth and accurate functioning of the application.

## Outputs 📊
The application provides detailed and insightful output files:

- CountsandControls.out
- Errors.out
- ReturnsReport.out
- SLReport.out

These files give you a complete understanding of your data and the operations performed.

## How To Run 🏃‍♀️
Please note, this project requires a Mainframe environment to run. Once the environment setup is complete, upload the provided .cbl and .dat files to your Mainframe. Use the necessary commands to compile and run the .cbl files.

## Contribute 🤝
Feel free to contribute to Project1! Whether you have a knack for identifying bugs, a mind full of feature enhancements, or just want to work on some code improvements, we'd love to see your pull requests.
